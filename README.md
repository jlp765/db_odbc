# db_odbc
Nim ODBC library consistent with the nim db_xxxxxx libraries

Currently all queries are ANSI calls, not Unicode.

Tested odbc databases:
 * Oracle, 
 * Sybase, 
 * MSSqlvSvr, 
 * Firebird

### History
This initially started in the Nim standard Library, but was removed because it lacks stability (not extensively tested against many database types.
